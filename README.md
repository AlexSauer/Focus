# Focus

This swift macOS app implements the [Pomodoro-Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) using a simple timer. It's my first project in swift so any tips to improve the code (which is loosley based on a tutorial by www.raywenderlich.com) are welcome and appreciated!


# To-Dos:

- [x] Implement Break with timer that is not saved and starts automatically after the end of the Pomodoro
- [ ] Keep track of how many pomodoros have run and suggest a longer break after n runs
- [ ] Implement the windows to view the history
- [ ] Implement calendar integration (additionally to adding the event to the history we also add a calendar event)
- [ ] Change volume of the Ding at the end (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25394627/how-to-lower-the-volume-of-music-in-swift)
- [ ] Different sound for pomodoro and break timer?
- [ ] Show a notification if the timer is over
- [ ] Can I show the preferences in the same window as the timer?
- [ ] Give each pomodoro a short title after the timer is over by prompting a small window (if the settings are like this )and save it in the history
- [ ] Add status/menu bar icon and timer
