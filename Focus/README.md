# Focus

This swift macOS app implements the [Pomodoro-Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) using a simple timer. It's my first project in swift so any tips to improve the code (which is loosley based on a tutorial by www.raywenderlich.com) are welcome and appreciated!


# To-Dos:

- [x] Implement Break with timer that is not saved and starts automatically after the end of the Pomodoro
- [] Implement the windows to view the history
- [] Implement calendar integration (additionally to adding the event to the history we also add a calendar event)
- [] Change volume of the Ding at the end (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25394627/how-to-lower-the-volume-of-music-in-swift)
- [] Add status/menu bar icon and timer
- [] Different sound for pomodoro and break timer?
