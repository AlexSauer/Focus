- [] Implement Break with timer that is not saved and starts automatically after the end of the Pomodoro
- [] Implement the windows to view the history
- [] Implement calendar integration (additionally to adding the event to the history we also add a calendar event)
- [] Change volume of the Ding at the end (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25394627/how-to-lower-the-volume-of-music-in-swift)
